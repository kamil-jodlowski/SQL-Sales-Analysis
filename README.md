# SQL-Sales-Analysis

 The SQL project for sales data analysis is created as part of my portfolio.The database contains the structure of customers, products, orders and order details. This project demonstrates my skills in database design and creating effective SQL queries.


Sales Data Analysis Project

This project includes a database schema and SQL queries for sales data analysis. The main objective of the project is to analyze customer, product, order, and transaction data in a business context.

Database Structure

The project comprises the following tables:

Customers Table:
Stores customer details including customer ID, customer name, email, and phone number.

Products Table:
Manages product information such as product ID, product name, category, and unit price.

Orders Table:
Tracks order specifics such as order ID, customer ID, order date, with references to the Customers table for customer details.

Order Details Table:
Contains detailed information about products within orders, including order detail ID, order ID, product ID, quantity, and unit price.

Each table includes primary keys and foreign keys to maintain data integrity. Sample data has been inserted into the Customers, Products, Orders, and Order Details tables to illustrate the database structure and functionality.
